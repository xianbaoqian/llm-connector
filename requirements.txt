LLM Connector
Welcome to LLM Connector, your seamless solution for bridging the gap between various HTTP services and Language Model APIs, like OpenAI. With LLM Connector, you can effortlessly forward and manage HTTP requests, ensuring smooth communication between your applications and external services.

Goal
The primary goal of LLM Connector is to simplify and streamline the process of routing HTTP requests to language model APIs and other services, making integration effortless and efficient. Whether you're developing a chatbot, an AI-driven application, or any service requiring robust language processing capabilities, LLM Connector is here to make your life easier.

Features
Easy Request Forwarding: Forward HTTP requests to any service with ease, maintaining the original request path and method.
Support for Multiple Methods: Handle GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH requests seamlessly.
Efficient and Fast: Built using FastAPI and httpx for high performance and reliability.
Extensible: Easily customizable to fit your specific needs.
Installation
To get started with LLM Connector, first install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install fastapi uvicorn httpx
Usage
Here's how you can set up and run your LLM Connector server:

Create a file named proxy_server.py and add the following code:
python
Copy code
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import Response
import httpx

app = FastAPI()

# The URL of the target service to forward requests to
TARGET_SERVICE_URL = 'http://target-service-url.com'

@app.api_route("/{path:path}", methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH"])
async def proxy(request: Request, path: str):
    url = f"{TARGET_SERVICE_URL}/{path}"
    method = request.method
    headers = request.headers
    params = request.query_params
    body = await request.body()

    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        if method == 'GET':
            response = await client.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
        elif method == 'POST':
            response = await client.post(url, headers=headers, content=body)
        elif method == 'PUT':
            response = await client.put(url, headers=headers, content=body)
        elif method == 'DELETE':
            response = await client.delete(url, headers=headers)
        elif method == 'PATCH':
            response = await client.patch(url, headers=headers, content=body)
        else:
            return Response(content="Method not supported", status_code=405)

    return Response(content=response.content, status_code=response.status_code, headers=dict(response.headers))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
Run the server:
bash
Copy code
python proxy_server.py
Test the server with a script like test_proxy.py:
python
Copy code
import httpx

# URL of your proxy server
PROXY_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'
# Target OpenAI URL
OPENAI_API_URL = 'https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci/completions'

# Construct the full URL through the proxy
url = f"{PROXY_URL}/v1/engines/davinci/completions"

# Your OpenAI API key
api_key = 'your_openai_api_key_here'

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

data = {
    "prompt": "Once upon a time",
    "max_tokens": 5
}

# Send the request through the proxy
response = httpx.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

# Print the response from the OpenAI API
print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
print("Response Body:", response.json())
Examples
Forwarding a Chatbot Request
Imagine you're developing a chatbot that needs to process natural language using OpenAI's API. With LLM Connector, you can route user messages through your proxy server to OpenAI seamlessly:

python
Copy code
# User sends a message to your chatbot
user_message = "Tell me a joke."

# Your chatbot forwards this message to OpenAI via LLM Connector
response = httpx.post('http://localhost:8000/v1/engines/davinci/completions', headers=headers, json={"prompt": user_message, "max_tokens": 50})

# The response is processed and returned to the user
print("Chatbot Response:", response.json())
Integrating with External Services
LLM Connector also allows you to integrate other external services without worrying about the complexities of direct API calls:

python
Copy code
# Forward a data processing request to an external service
response = httpx.get('http://localhost:8000/data/process', params={"data": "sample data"})

# Process the response from the external service
print("Processed Data:", response.json())
Benefits
Simplicity: Focus on your core application logic while LLM Connector handles request routing.
Flexibility: Easily adapt to changes in API endpoints and service providers.
Scalability: Built on FastAPI, ensuring your proxy can handle high loads and performance demands.
